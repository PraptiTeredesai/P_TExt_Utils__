// Props:
// Definition: Short for "properties," props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.
// Purpose: They make components reusable and dynamic by enabling customization.
// Immutable: Props are read-only; they cannot be modified by the receiving component.
// PropTypes:
// Definition: A way to validate the type and presence of props in a component.
// Purpose: Helps catch bugs by ensuring that components receive props of the correct type.
// Usage: Add a propTypes property to the component to define the expected props.
// jsx


// State - State is a built-in object in React that holds data or information about the component. 
// It allows React components to respond and render dynamically to user input, events, or any other changes in data.
// Key points - managed within component, changes over time (setstate, usestate), Triggers re-rendering
